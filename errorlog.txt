//TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined
  51 |     this.target = target;
  52 |     // static values
  53 |     this.name = movelist[this.index][this.order];
> 54 |     this.description = desc[this.name][this.order];
  55 |     this.flavor = flav[this.name][this.order];
  56 |   }
  57 | }

  solution: not to rearrange code until you have an idea of what you're doing

// ./src/assets/avatars.js
Module not found: Can't resolve './dictionary' in '../../projects/RPG-Battle-Sim-Remake/src/assets'
This error occurred during the build time and cannot be dismissed.

solution: change paths in all files check all files for this that need it

TypeError: Cannot read property 'map' of undefined
(anonymous function)
src/assets/attack.js:127

  125 | const moves = elements.map((elem, i) => {
  126 |   console.log(movelists[elem]);
> 127 |   movelists[elem].map((e, j) => new Move(i, j));
  128 | });
  129 |
  130 | console.log(moves);

  solution: make sure all arrays and/or objects are complete before iterating over them

  TypeError: Cannot read property '0' of undefined
new Move
src/assets/attack.js:62
  59 |     this.effect = effects[this.element][this.order].effect;
  60 |     this.area = effects[this.element][this.order].area;
  61 |     this.target = effects[this.element][this.order].target;
> 62 |     this.description = desc[this.element][this.order];
  63 |     this.flavor = flav[this.element][this.order];
  64 |   }
  65 | }

  solution: same as above

  Button(...): Nothing was returned from render. This usually means a return statement is missing. Or, to render nothing, return null.

  solution: return something in functional components
