# RPG-Battle-Sim-Remake
A complete rewrite of the RPG Battle Sim, with added features

## Summary
The RPG Battle Simulator is a short boss run where you can select the boss you face and the allies who fight alongside you. You can select a party of 4 against a powerful enemy. The idea behind this battle simulator is to emulate the turn-based battles of older RPGs (such as the Final Fantasy series of the NES era) with a modern twist. In particular, my goal is to emulate the spirit of desgin of modern mobage RPGs like Fate/Grand Order. The focus is on pure combat, since for many RPGs, one of the most important parts apart from the story is the combat. Ultimately, my goal is to make a full scale RPG, so this is a proof of concept of a working battle system.

## User Story
This is what the expected functionality of the app will be.
### User
As a user (player), I expect to battle strong enemies with a party of allies in an entertaining combat system.
Parameters of game:

- Ability to win by reducing boss HP to zero
- Ability to lose by having all party members' HPs to zero
- Ability to return to character select screen and fight again with new characters
